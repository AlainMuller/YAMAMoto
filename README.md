Yet Another Meteo Application for Motorcyclists

This is my pet project to learn Kotlin while developping an Android app.

The concept of this app is to help motorcyclists (or cyclists) decide about should they ride or not today (based on the weather and on their scheduled trip to work).

This is a Work In Progress and more features will be added soon! =)
